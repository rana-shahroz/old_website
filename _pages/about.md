My name is Rana Muhammad Shahroz Khan ( I go by Rana ). I am a rising Junior at Vanderbilt University currently working with Dr. Soheil Kolouri in their Mathematical Intelligence and Neural Technologies Lab (MINT Lab). <br>

**Interests :** My interests lie in the intersection of Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning and their research as well implementation. I am interested in the research regarding these fields but I am also interested in the practical implications these abstract research ideas generate. <br>
